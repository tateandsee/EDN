## Plugin Development Framework

### Creating a New Plugin
```typescript
import { BasePlugin } from '@/lib/plugins/base-plugin'

export class MyPlugin extends BasePlugin {
  public metadata = {
    id: 'my-plugin',
    name: 'My Custom Plugin',
    version: '1.0.0',
    description: 'A custom plugin for specific functionality',
    author: 'Developer Name',
    category: 'utility',
    enabled: true,
    priority: 50
  }

  protected async onInitialize(): Promise<void> {
    // Plugin initialization logic
  }

  protected async onDestroy(): Promise<void> {
    // Plugin cleanup logic
  }

  protected registerHooks(): Record<string, Function> {
    return {
      'my-custom-hook': this.handleCustomHook.bind(this)
    }
  }
}
```

### Plugin Capabilities
1. **Hook System**: Listen to and trigger system events
2. **Route Registration**: Add custom API endpoints
3. **Component Registration**: Add UI components to the platform
4. **Settings Management**: User-configurable plugin settings
5. **Service Access**: Access to core platform services
6. **Logging**: Integrated logging system

import { BaseService } from '@/services/core/service-registry'

export class MyService extends BaseService {
  public metadata = {
    name: 'my-service',
    version: '1.0.0',
    description: 'Custom service implementation',
    dependencies: ['database'],
    singleton: true,
    priority: 75
  }

  protected async onInitialize(): Promise<void> {
    // Service initialization logic
  }

    type: 'schema' as const,
    rollback: true,
    created: new Date(),
    author: 'Developer Name'
  }

  protected async onExecute(): Promise<void> {
    await this.executeSql(`
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS my_table (
        id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
        name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
      )
