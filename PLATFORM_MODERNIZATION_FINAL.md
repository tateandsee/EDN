## üöÄ Platform Capabilities

### Plugin Development Framework
The platform now supports a complete plugin development ecosystem:

```typescript
// Example: Creating a new plugin
export class MyPlugin extends BasePlugin {
  public metadata = {
    id: 'my-plugin',
    name: 'My Custom Plugin',
    version: '1.0.0',
    description: 'Advanced functionality extension',
    category: 'utility',
    enabled: true,
    priority: 50
  }

  protected async onInitialize(): Promise<void> {
    // Plugin initialization logic
  }

  protected registerHooks(): Record<string, (...args: any[]) => any> {
    return {
      'custom-event': this.handleCustomEvent.bind(this)
    }
  }

  protected registerRoutes(): PluginRoute[] {
    return [{
      path: '/api/plugins/my-plugin/data',
      method: 'GET',
      handler: this.handleDataRequest.bind(this)
    }]
  }
}
```

### Service Development Framework
Services can be easily added and managed:

```typescript
// Example: Creating a new service
export class MyService extends BaseService {
  public metadata = {
    name: 'my-service',
    version: '1.0.0',
    description: 'Custom business logic service',
    dependencies: ['database'],
    singleton: true,
    priority: 75
  }

  protected async onInitialize(): Promise<void> {
    // Service initialization
  }

  async healthCheck(): Promise<{ healthy: boolean; details?: any }> {
    // Health check implementation
  }
}
```

### Migration Management
Database and configuration changes are now safe and trackable:

```typescript
// Example: Creating a migration
export class MyMigration extends BaseMigration {
  public migration = {
    id: 'my-migration',
    name: 'Schema Enhancement',
    version: '1.0.0',
    type: 'schema' as const,
    rollback: true,
    created: new Date(),
    author: 'Development Team'
  }

  protected async onExecute(): Promise<void> {
    await this.executeSql(`
      CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS enhanced_features (
        id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
        config JSON NOT NULL,
        created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
      )
    `)
  }
}
```
